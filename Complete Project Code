# Workshop Attended: EventHub - Centralized Event Management System

## Introduction
EventHub is a comprehensive solution designed to address the inefficiencies in managing academic and professional events. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, EventHub offers a seamless, interactive, and efficient experience for both organizers and attendees.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up EventHub, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- **Wamp Server**: Installed and running.
- **Node.js**: Installed on your system.

## Installation Steps
1. **Download and Extract the Project**:
   - Download the project zip file from the provided Google Drive link.
   - Extract it to your desired location on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Change the directory to the extracted project folder:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/workshop-attended
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the project dependencies using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Configure the Backend Database (SQL Express)**:
   - Locate the configuration file for the backend (e.g., `config.js`).
   - Update it with your SQL Express database connection details, including host, username, password, and database name.

5. **Start the Node.js Server**:
   - Start the Node.js server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Once the server is running, open your web browser.
   - Navigate to http://localhost:<port>, where `<port>` is the port on which your Node.js server is running (usually 3000 by default unless specified otherwise).

7. **Test the Application**:
   - Test the functionality of the application to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly before starting the server.
- Double-check the backend configuration to ensure it matches your SQL Express database setup.
- If you encounter any errors or issues during the setup process, refer to the project documentation or seek assistance from the project contributors.
